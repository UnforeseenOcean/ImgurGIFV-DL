# ImgurGIFV-DL
Downloads .gifv (AKA .mp4) from Imgur because browsers do not support it

Yes, I fed up with that shit and I made this little program to help your memeing duties.

Seriously? You have THAT many developers and you couldn't figure out how to make browsers download MP4 instead of HTML?

Here's the solution. I'm out.

If you want to compile this yourself, get all the file EXCEPT the `.exe` file.

Else, you can just get `.exe` file and use it. Put it into a folder, else it will create bunch of files near the executable.

Compiled with Ahk2Exe.
